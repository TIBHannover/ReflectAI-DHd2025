Conversion of Mary Magdalen

Schalcken portrayed Mary Magdalene with delicate brushwork and rendered her surroundings with an exacting eye for detail. We see her seated beside a sarcophagus; on it lies a thick book and on top of that a burning oil lamp, which she grips with her right hand. 
The light from this lamp falls mainly on the saint’s nearly naked bosom. 
The Magdalen raises her left arm and turns her head upward in the direction of a number of angels, who hold a palm branch and a wreath and are bathed in a heavenly light. 
This supernatural illumination also falls on her head. 
Around her neck she wears a broken pearl necklace, and at her feet lie two costly pieces of cloth in purple and blue. 
Arrayed on these fabrics are gold and silver plates, cups and other precious objects, including a string of pearls and a gold medal hanging from a blue ribbon. 
The saint’s left foot treads on an imperial crown, next to which lies a gold scepter, another symbol of worldly power. 
The left side of the composition is closed off by a large, red drapery decorated with fringe, which catches the light coming from the left from a source outside the picture. 
A round column on a high base stands behind Mary Magdalene, and visible at the right is a nocturnal view of a rough sea, with several ships in distress. 
This last scene refers to the Legenda Aurea, which tells how the Magdalen boarded an unnavigable boat in Palestine and finally disembarked in the south of France, near Marseille.

Hunter Getting Dressed after Bathing

In one of the most remarkable and unexpected paintings in Dutch art, Gabriel Metsu has here portrayed himself as a seated nude bather putting on his shirt after a dip in the water. 
Not at all modest, he smiles at the viewer like an actor addressing his audience. 
Lying on the ground near him are his rifle and powder horn, while the dead hare hanging from a tree branch suggests that he has taken his swim to cool off after his successful hunt. 
Standing patiently by his side is his faithful dog. 
Other, smaller figures are seen in the background, including a nude bather and a couple walking along a road near the bridge spanning the water where a man stands observing the scene. 
Given the watery terrain of the Netherlands, remarkably few works actually depict people enjoying a swim. 
Bathers are sometimes seen in landscape paintings by, among others, Philips Wouwerman (1619–68), Paulus Potter (1625–54), and Jacob van Ruisdael (1628/29–82), but they are generally small-scale figures and not individualized as in this case.

Man with a Book

In a bare, darkened interior, an elegantly dressed man sits at a table before an open book. 
Paused in his reading, he distractedly turns the cord of his collar between his fingers as his left hand rests on the book’s pages. 
Light catches the buttons and right sleeve of his fur trimmed tabard, a sixteenth-century garment associated with learning and the scholarly tradition, and delicately accents the refinements of his dress.
The sitter’s plush black beret sits on soft waves of long hair and gently casts a shadow over the left side of his slightly blushed face. 
Bol rendered the man’s features with careful contrasts of light and dark, modeling his form against the deep brown background. 
The man’s considered state of intellectual contemplation, his sophisticated, historicizing costume, and the books lining the back wall situate him within the pictorial tradition of the scholar in his study.
Images of a scholar in his study were popular in the seventeenth century. 
Rembrandt van Rijn (1606–69), with whom Bol studied in the late 1630s and early 1640s, treated the theme a number of times, as did Gerrit Dou (1613–75).
For his image, Ferdinand Bol relied on the compositional model provided by Rembrandt in his 1635 etching of Johannes Uytenbogaert(fig 1), in which the prominent Remonstrant minister, dressed in a similar tabard and a black skullcap and seated before a table and large opened book, has paused from reading.

Perseus und Andromeda

Zauner is the last major sculptor in Vienna, dating from the 18th century. 
From 1776 to 1781 he studied ancient excavations, as well as the works of Michelangelo and Raphael, then headed the sculpture class at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, where he was director from 1806 to 1815. 
He succeeded his friend Friedrich Heinrich Füger in this role.
The painter and sculptor were instrumental in making the Imperial Academy one of the most important art schools in Europe in the 1800s. 
The small group of figures, Perseus and Andromeda, was formed in the first year of the Roman occupation, as the signature indicates. 
The moment is immediately after the release of the chains that bound Andromeda to the stone.
As the woman leaves the rock, she looks at the monster, whose big mouth is pushing to the left under the rock.
But her Perseus is helpful.
His posture of the highest elegance, like the gallantry of the outspoken Ancien Regime, and his supporting arm, which encircles Andromeda's body, shapes her hesitant steps forward with the highest grace.

Portrait of Laura Dianti

Portrait of Laura Dianti is a c. 1520–25 painting by Titian, now held in the H. Kisters Collection at Kreuzlingen. 
It is signed "TICI/ANVS F." 
The portrait features Laura Dianti, mistress, and later wife of the Duke of Ferrara Alfonso I d'Este and an African page. 
She is dressed in a blue dress with her hand placed on the shoulder of her page as he looks up at her.
The painting is possibly associated with a portrait of Alfonso I d'Este.
It is also controversial in that it was used to contest the legitimacy of the pair's marriage after the duke's death.
It traveled through many locations and was initially thought to be one of many copies until a restoration uncovered a signature by Titian.
