Perseus und Andromeda

Zauner is the last major sculptor in Vienna, dating from the 18th century. 
From 1776 to 1781 he studied ancient excavations, as well as the works of Michelangelo and Raphael, then headed the sculpture class at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, where he was director from 1806 to 1815. 
He succeeded his friend Friedrich Heinrich FÃ¼ger in this role.
The painter and sculptor were instrumental in making the Imperial Academy one of the most important art schools in Europe in the 1800s. 
The small group of figures, Perseus and Andromeda, was formed in the first year of the Roman occupation, as the signature indicates. 
The moment is immediately after the release of the chains that bound Andromeda to the stone.
As the woman leaves the rock, she looks at the monster, whose big mouth is pushing to the left under the rock.
But her Perseus is helpful.
His posture of the highest elegance, like the gallantry of the outspoken Ancien Regime, and his supporting arm, which encircles Andromeda's body, shapes her hesitant steps forward with the highest grace.
