Conversion of Mary Magdalen

Schalcken portrayed Mary Magdalene with delicate brushwork and rendered her surroundings with an exacting eye for detail. We see her seated beside a sarcophagus; on it lies a thick book and on top of that a burning oil lamp, which she grips with her right hand. 
The light from this lamp falls mainly on the saint’s nearly naked bosom. 
The Magdalen raises her left arm and turns her head upward in the direction of a number of angels, who hold a palm branch and a wreath and are bathed in a heavenly light. 
This supernatural illumination also falls on her head. 
Around her neck she wears a broken pearl necklace, and at her feet lie two costly pieces of cloth in purple and blue. 
Arrayed on these fabrics are gold and silver plates, cups and other precious objects, including a string of pearls and a gold medal hanging from a blue ribbon. 
The saint’s left foot treads on an imperial crown, next to which lies a gold scepter, another symbol of worldly power. 
The left side of the composition is closed off by a large, red drapery decorated with fringe, which catches the light coming from the left from a source outside the picture. 
A round column on a high base stands behind Mary Magdalene, and visible at the right is a nocturnal view of a rough sea, with several ships in distress. 
This last scene refers to the Legenda Aurea, which tells how the Magdalen boarded an unnavigable boat in Palestine and finally disembarked in the south of France, near Marseille.
