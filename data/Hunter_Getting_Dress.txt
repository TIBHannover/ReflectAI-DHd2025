Hunter Getting Dressed after Bathing

In one of the most remarkable and unexpected paintings in Dutch art, Gabriel Metsu has here portrayed himself as a seated nude bather putting on his shirt after a dip in the water. 
Not at all modest, he smiles at the viewer like an actor addressing his audience. 
Lying on the ground near him are his rifle and powder horn, while the dead hare hanging from a tree branch suggests that he has taken his swim to cool off after his successful hunt. 
Standing patiently by his side is his faithful dog. 
Other, smaller figures are seen in the background, including a nude bather and a couple walking along a road near the bridge spanning the water where a man stands observing the scene. 
Given the watery terrain of the Netherlands, remarkably few works actually depict people enjoying a swim. 
Bathers are sometimes seen in landscape paintings by, among others, Philips Wouwerman (1619–68), Paulus Potter (1625–54), and Jacob van Ruisdael (1628/29–82), but they are generally small-scale figures and not individualized as in this case.
