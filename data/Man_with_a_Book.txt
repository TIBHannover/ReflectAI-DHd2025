Man with a Book

In a bare, darkened interior, an elegantly dressed man sits at a table before an open book. 
Paused in his reading, he distractedly turns the cord of his collar between his fingers as his left hand rests on the book’s pages. 
Light catches the buttons and right sleeve of his fur trimmed tabard, a sixteenth-century garment associated with learning and the scholarly tradition, and delicately accents the refinements of his dress.
The sitter’s plush black beret sits on soft waves of long hair and gently casts a shadow over the left side of his slightly blushed face. 
Bol rendered the man’s features with careful contrasts of light and dark, modeling his form against the deep brown background. 
The man’s considered state of intellectual contemplation, his sophisticated, historicizing costume, and the books lining the back wall situate him within the pictorial tradition of the scholar in his study.
Images of a scholar in his study were popular in the seventeenth century. 
Rembrandt van Rijn (1606–69), with whom Bol studied in the late 1630s and early 1640s, treated the theme a number of times, as did Gerrit Dou (1613–75).
For his image, Ferdinand Bol relied on the compositional model provided by Rembrandt in his 1635 etching of Johannes Uytenbogaert(fig 1), in which the prominent Remonstrant minister, dressed in a similar tabard and a black skullcap and seated before a table and large opened book, has paused from reading.
