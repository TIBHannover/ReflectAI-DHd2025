Portrait of Laura Dianti

Portrait of Laura Dianti is a c. 1520â€“25[1] painting by Titian, now held in the H. Kisters Collection at Kreuzlingen. 
It is signed "TICI/ANVS F." 
The portrait features Laura Dianti, mistress, and later wife of the Duke of Ferrara Alfonso I d'Este and an African page. 
She is dressed in a blue dress with her hand placed on the shoulder of her page as he looks up at her.[2] 
The painting is possibly associated with a portrait of Alfonso I d'Este.[3] 
It is also controversial in that it was used to contest the legitimacy of the pair's marriage after the duke's death.[2] 
It traveled through many locations[3] and was initially thought to be one of many copies until a restoration uncovered a signature by Titian.[4]
